#+TITLE: SICP notes
These are my personal notes for [[https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html][SICP]].

I used [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][Guile]] as my scheme implementation, and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] as my editor with
[[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] for taking notes. Feel free to read, copy, and use my messy
notes and solutions; there is no guarantee any are correct.
